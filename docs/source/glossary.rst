   PeLEE
      The Pandora electron Low Energy Excess, corresponding to both a
      MicroBooNE physics analysis and the associated data production workflows
      used for that analysis.

   detvar
      Detector variation files produced for a series of alternative physics
      models that can be used to simulate detector response. These form part of
      the characterisation of systematic uncertainties in cross-section
      analyses.

   ``stv-tree`` ntuple
      A ROOT TTree/NTuple produced from the ProcessNTuples program.

   Pandora
      The Pandora Multi-algorithm Pattern Recognition Framework, designed to
      reconstruct track and shower objects from ionisation energy depositions
      in the TPC.

   .. Unfolding
   ..    The process of correcting for detector-induced effects on the measured
   ..    cross-section. These effects lead to events in
